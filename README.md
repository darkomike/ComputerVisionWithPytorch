# Computer Vision With PyTorch

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating fundamental concepts in computer vision and neural networks using PyTorch.

## Notebooks

- **Feed_Forward_Propagation.ipynb**: Implements feed-forward propagation in a neural network, showing how inputs are processed through layers to produce outputs.

- **Gradient_Descent.ipynb**: Demonstrates gradient descent optimization algorithm used for training neural networks, including weight updates and loss minimization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch (if applicable in future notebooks)

## Usage

Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or VS Code to run the code cells and see the visualizations.
